# Ghost_hunter_AI_Project
* AI-game-LinesOfAction: Used minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning with suitable heuristics to create and agent which is able to play the board game. Can also be played in multiplayer mode.
* Ghost Hunting: Modeled Ghost Hunting problem using HMM and Particle Filtering.
* Latin Square CSP Solver: Used several CSP solving algorithms with heuristics to solve latin square.
* Optimal Exam Scheduling with local search: Exam scheduling problem was solved by local search with appropriate heuristics.
* Solving n-puzzle by A-star search: Solved n-puzzle problem with A-star search by using two heuristics (the misplaced tiles an the Manhattan distance).
